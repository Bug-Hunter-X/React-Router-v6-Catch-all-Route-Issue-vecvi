# React Router v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router v6.  The catch-all route is intended to handle any unmatched paths, but it may not work as expected due to the order of routes, leading to incorrect rendering. 

The `App.js` file shows the problematic code, and `AppSolution.js` provides a solution.
